# Java Client Billing Tool 

## Client Billing 0.1.0 

This is a simple client billing tool written in Java.

It allows you to keep track of time spent on any hourly job and how much to
bill the client. A running timer can be started/stopped when time is spent on
the job and a running total is displayed based on the hourly rate specified by
the user. Billable hours are tracked in 15 minute increments and a billable
amount can be seen during the job.
