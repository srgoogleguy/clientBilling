# Java Client Billing Tool 

## Client Billing 0.1.0 

__A simple tool written in Java for calculating your billable hours.__

__Client Billing__ is a simple tool, written in Java, that allows you to keep
track of the hours you’ve spent on a job and how much to bill the client, based
on your hourly rate. It’s a nice tool for anyone that does freelance/contract
work and bills clients based on a fixed hourly rate. It’s particularly useful
if you’re doing your work on or near a computer so that you can keep track of
the running total for the job. I built this as a simple proof of concept based
on a similar tool I wrote in C#. This version is much more simplistic and can
only keep track of a single job at a time.
